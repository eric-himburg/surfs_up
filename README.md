# Surf's Up
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
In order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu were collected and analyzed.  Oahu is third largest Hawiian island, is home to roughly one million people and has over five million tourists visit it each year.  Given the large amount of people and the popularity of its beaches, if the weather is consistently good a store which deals in both surfing gear and ice cream has a good chance of succeeding.
