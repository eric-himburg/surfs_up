# Surf's Up
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
In order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu were collected and analyzed.  Oahu is third largest Hawiian island, is home to roughly one million people and has over five million tourists visit it each year.  Given the large amount of people and the popularity of its beaches, if the weather is consistently good a store which deals in both surfing gear and ice cream has a good chance of succeeding.   In Hawaii, the climate is tropical, with a hot season from June to October (called kau in the Hawaiian language) and a relatively cool season (hooilo) from December to March.  The question the data will answer is how hot and how cool it gets in each of the seasons.      

## Results
Reviewing the temperature data, there are three key differences which will be highlighted.
* The median temperature is higher in June versus December.  Two tables with summary statitics for the months of June and December can be seen below.  The median June temperature (50%) is 75 째F while it is 71 째F for December.  Additionally, the maximum temperature is 85 째F and 83 째F for June and December, respectively.  Hence, one can expect warmer weather during the month of June versus December.
